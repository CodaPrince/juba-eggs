🥚 About Us — JUBA EGGS
JUBA ELEDUMARE

At JUBA EGGS, we believe that something as simple as an egg can make a powerful difference in everyday life. From family breakfasts to restaurant kitchens, bakeries, hotels, caterers, and food vendors, eggs are at the heart of nutrition, taste, and tradition. That belief is what inspired the birth of JUBA EGGS — JUBA ELEDUMARE, a brand built on trust, freshness, speed, and community.

We are more than just a delivery company. We are a food-supply partner, a reliability brand, and a growing household name dedicated to bringing high-quality eggs straight to your doorstep with professionalism and care.

🌍 Our Story

JUBA EGGS was founded with one simple idea: people deserve reliable access to fresh eggs without stress. Markets can be crowded, transport can be difficult, and bulk buyers often struggle with consistency and breakage. We saw an opportunity to change that.

Starting from humble beginnings, our team worked closely with poultry farmers, suppliers, and logistics partners to build a system that focuses on quality control, careful handling, and on-time delivery. Over time, JUBA EGGS has grown into a dependable service trusted by families, retailers, restaurants, and institutions.

Our motto, “JUBA ELEDUMARE,” represents our commitment to excellence, responsibility, and service. It reminds us every day that integrity, discipline, and respect must guide everything we do — from farm to customer.
